## Codestyle 

### Marks

For clean struct code good is using marks. 

```swift
class Example {

    // MARK: - Init
    
    init() {}
}
```

Here you find all which using in project:

- // MARK: - Init
- // MARK: - Lifecycle
- // MARK: - Layout
- // MARK: - Public
- // MARK: - Private
- // MARK: - Internal
- // MARK: - Models
- // MARK: - Ovveride

If you can't find valid, add new to codestyle agreements please. Other can be use if class is large and need struct it even without adding to codestyle agreements.
